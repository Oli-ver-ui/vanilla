                   SOFTWARE Directory Contents

     The SOFTWARE directory contains software files for using the data on the
TES-TSDR archive volume.  The files and subdirectories listed below are found
in this directory.

SOFTINFO.TXT -  The file you are reading.

BIN - Subdirectory containing binary versions of the software.

DOC - Subdirectory containing documentation about the software.

SRC - Subdirectory containing source code for the software.




                     Notes on Getting Started
                     ------------------------
The TES data available on this volume is most easily manipulated with the 
Vanilla software included in the above subdirectories.  
SOFTWARE/BIN/BININFO.TXT lists the variety of systems for which compiled
binary executables are available;  instructions for executing the binary are 
also given in SOFTWARE/BIN/BININFO.TXT.  If your system is not supported, the
source codes for compiling your own version of Vanilla are available in 
SOFTWARE/SRC/; compiling instructions are given in SOFTWARE/SRC/SRCINFO.TXT.

In the case that you are unsure if one of the SOFTWARE/BIN/ executables will 
actually work with your system, we suggest that you first attempt to run the
executable before plowing through the source code;  you may be pleasantly 
surprised.
