                       BIN Directory Contents
 
     The BIN directory contains executable software files for using the
data on the TES-TSDR archive volume.  The files listed below are found
in this directory.

BININFO.TXT -   The file you are reading.


The files listed below are executables of the vanilla program, precompiled
for the following platforms:

irix.exe      - SGI Origin 2000 (mips), IRIX 6.5, gcc

linux.exe     - PC (i386), Fedora Core 1, gcc

rs6k.exe      - IBM RS/6000 (PPC), AIX V4.3.3

solsparc.exe  - Sun Sparc, Solaris 7, gcc 

wintel.exe    - PC, Windows2000/NT/98/95, Microsoft Visual C++

If no compiler is specified, then the system supplied compiler was used.
Where possible, these executables were compiled statically, to avoid 
shared library version problems.




                      Notes on Executing Vanilla
                      --------------------------
All of the above executables are copies of the Vanilla software, named by 
the system for which they were compiled.  To operate Vanilla on your system, 
follow these steps: 
  -copy the appropriate executable to your system into a common directory 
   for everyone to access 
  -rename the executable file "vanilla.exe" for Windows systems, or 
   "vanilla" for all other systems 
  -check that the file permissions are executable for everyone; modify the 
   permissions if necessary 
  -include the executable in your PATH variable (i.e. use the command 
   rehash for C shell systems) 

Vanilla commands can now be run following the instructions given in 
/SOFTWARE/DOC/USERDOC.TXT.
